# Documentation Review & Update Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Review Focus:** System features, options, and documentation completeness

---

## Executive Summary

I've completed a comprehensive review of the AI Job Candidate Reviewer system and identified several powerful features that were either undocumented or inadequately explained. I've created/updated documentation to ensure users can discover and leverage all capabilities.

### What Was Missing

1. **üîí Screening Filters** - Completely undocumented automated policy enforcement system
2. **üîÑ Re-evaluation Details** - Advanced features like score deltas, history tracking, rejected candidate handling
3. **üìö Learning Pipeline** - How insights generation and application works
4. **‚öôÔ∏è Filter Creation Workflow** - Interactive filter creation during feedback
5. **üìä Evaluation History** - Version tracking system

---

## New Documentation Created

### 1. SCREENING_FILTERS.md (NEW - 400+ lines)

**Comprehensive guide covering:**

#### What It Is
- Automated policy enforcement for hard requirements
- Two-layer architecture (AI + deterministic policy enforcement)
- Ensures consistent application of hiring criteria

#### How to Use It
- **Interactive creation** during feedback workflow (recommended)
- **Manual creation** by editing JSON files
- **Filter management** (enable/disable, view, modify)

#### Filter Actions
| Action | Effect | Example Use Case |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| `set_recommendation` | Force specific recommendation | Auto-reject candidates without required certification |
| `cap_recommendation` | Limit maximum recommendation | Cap candidates with concerns at MAYBE |
| `deduct_points` | Subtract from score | Penalize job hopping without auto-rejection |

#### Common Examples
- Minimum years of experience requirements
- Required technical skills
- Red flags (job hopping, poor communication)
- Compliance requirements (work authorization)

#### Architecture Details
- **Layer 1 (AI):** Evaluates conditions, applies penalties
- **Layer 2 (Policy):** Deterministically enforces penalties (catches AI mistakes)
- Why two layers: Ensures reliability despite AI variability

#### Best Practices
- Writing clear, specific conditions
- Testing filters before enabling
- Combining multiple actions
- Documentation and rationale

#### Troubleshooting
- Filter not being applied
- Filter too aggressive/not specific enough
- Debugging steps

## Key Insights for Users

### 1. Screening Filters Are Powerful

**What they do:**
- Automatically enforce hard requirements (e.g., "must have 5+ years Python")
- Consistently reject or downgrade unqualified candidates
- Save time by automating first-pass screening

**How to use:**
- Create interactively during feedback when rejecting candidates
- System prompts: "Create a screening filter from this rejection?"
- Define title, condition, and action (set/cap recommendation, deduct points)

**Why it works:**
- Two-layer architecture ensures AI can't make mistakes
- Policy layer deterministically enforces exact penalties
- Reliable despite AI model variability

### 2. Re-evaluation Is Smart

**Smart behaviors:**
- **Score deltas:** Shows "was 60 ‚Üí now 75 | Œî +15" for each candidate
- **Skip rejected:** Doesn't waste API calls on already-rejected candidates
- **Highest first:** Processes top candidates first to focus on quality
- **Stale cleanup:** Removes outdated duplicate warnings automatically

**What it tracks:**
- Full evaluation history in `evaluation_history.json`
- Enables auditing how AI improved over time
- Can manually rollback if needed

**When to use:**
- After providing feedback (insights generated)
- After modifying screening filters
- After changing job requirements (ideal_candidate.txt, warning_flags.txt)

### 3. Filters vs Insights

**Two complementary systems:**

| Aspect | Screening Filters | Insights |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Type** | Hard rules | Soft guidance |
| **Enforcement** | Deterministic (always applied) | Interpretive (AI uses judgment) |
| **Use For** | Deal-breakers, minimums, compliance | Preferences, nuanced criteria |
| **Creation** | Manual or during feedback | Auto-generated from feedback patterns |
| **Examples** | "Must have 5+ years Python" | "Prioritize practical skills over years" |

**Best practice:** Use both together
- Filters catch unqualified candidates automatically
- Insights help AI better evaluate qualified candidates

### 4. Feedback Loop Improves Results

**The cycle:**
1. **Provide feedback** ‚Üí Tell AI what it got wrong
2. **Insights auto-generate** ‚Üí After every 2 feedback records
3. **Re-evaluate** ‚Üí Apply improved understanding
4. **See improvements** ‚Üí Score deltas show changes

**Example progression:**
- Initial eval: John Doe = 60 (MAYBE) - "Overvalued years of experience"
- After feedback & insights: 75 (YES) - "Now properly weighs practical skills"

### 5. Interactive Features Are Discoverable

**The system guides you:**
- Feedback prompts walk through rating, scoring, explaining
- Filter creation is offered when rejecting (with prefilled text)
- Re-evaluation suggests timing ("2 feedback records, time for insights")
- Progress indicators show "Re-evaluating 3/10..."

**Philosophy:**
- Make powerful features easy to discover
- Reduce manual work through automation
- Provide clear feedback on what's happening

## What's Not Documented (Intentionally)

Some internal implementation details are intentionally left to code comments:

- **Internal APIs** - Function signatures in code files
- **Test infrastructure** - Test files are self-documenting
- **Prompt engineering** - AI prompts in `ai_client.py`
- **Data models** - Defined in `models.py` with type hints

These are better maintained in code than in separate documentation.
